Thomas Grogan Music Website
Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
For this project I just to create a site for my own music. I am a trained singer and performing artist who performs regularly for concerts, shows, weddings and other events. The site provides images of performances, video clips, audio clips, a bio, and a contact form for bookings, etc.

UX
My aim was to provide visitors with an accessible depiction of myself and my performance capabilities. The atmospheric image for the landing page was chosen to convey the mystery and art of stage performance. A brief biography follows which quickly introduces the reader to me as an individual and as a performer. This biography is accompanied by a headshot on larger screens. This is followed by two embedded YouTube videos of me performing songs on one of my CD recordings and an audio player. It was important to have the video and audio near the top of the site as the user quickly gets to hear me performing. Next there is a carousel of images from my latest musical theatre production: Jesus Christ Superstar. The user has now both heard and seen me in action. Finally, there is a contact form which makes it very easy for a user to get in touch with me to discuss a booking. This is followed by links to Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter accounts.

Technologies
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (4.3.1), Font Awesome, Google Fonts

Features
•	A navbar at the top of the landing page grants the user quick and easy access to other parts of the site. These links collapse on tablets and mobile devices in order to provide a more appealing experience.
•	A Bootstrap carousel is used to display images of stage performances. 
•	A contact form at the end of the site allows the visitor to easily get in touch with the website owner. 
•	Font Awesome icons are used to provide links to social accounts. These icons expand and change colour when hovered over.
•	A link at the bottom of the page allows the user to quickly return to the top.

Testing
The intended outcome was achieved. Any potential clients who wish to enquire about services for weddings or other events are given a description of me and my performance ability. They get to see and hear me perform. They are given links to other sites for more information and access to a CV. Finally, they are given an opportunity to complete the journey by contacting me about a booking or for more information.
The contact form cannot be submitted without a valid email address. The ‘required’ attribute has been added to the ‘name’, ‘email’, and ‘your query’ fields, so the form cannot be submitted unless these fields are completed. 
All links which lead away from the page will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"’All links have been tested to ensure that they lead to the correct location.
This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer) and on multiple devices (iPhone 5, iPad, Lenovo Tab, Samsung Galaxy S9) to check responsiveness and compatibility. 

Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages. It is deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. 
To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/thomasgrogan95/milestoneproject1 git into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
